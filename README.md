# hello-world
I currently make $21,000/year and am learning web design to broaden my horizons!

I am a 36 year old husband and father.  I have practically zero coding experience, but have started learning HTML and CSS.  I am technically minded and enjoy analyzing data in excel which makes me believe backend development/administration is where I would most likely feel at home.  I am very excited to be tackling this daunting challenge that could possibly lead to a career in web development!
